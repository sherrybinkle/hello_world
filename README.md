# hello_world
Hey this is a short description for the first repository that I have created.
I am currently studying in college and have decided to branch off a bit from my studies and become a full stack web developer.
At the moment I am busy designing a catering website for my mom using Drupal. Each new feature that I have to create is another quest of knowledge that I have to undergo. This makes me happy to have found GitHub. I should have come sooner.
